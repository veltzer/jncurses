move to OO (controvertial)
==========================
- stop using SWIG. need to do JNI object oriented on my own.
- exceptions. Errors from curses functions should cause exceptions.
	This needs to be discussed.

small stuff
===========
- make the new Makefile.ac file actually build the project.
- addch does not work because swig wraps the "chtype" typedef which is just char with
	a java type. Make him stop doing that!
- get the so file inside the library and have the library load it on initialization.
	steal the code from jna (sun microsystems).
- get rm from autoconf instead of hardcoding it in Makefile.in. How do I do that ? It seems that autoconf cannot find rm ? This is stupid!!! ? maybe write an autoconf macro ?
- write more demo programs in Java (fancy demos).
- do a perl script which checks that I'm doing all the functions in all the library
	(objdump ? manual pages ?)
- documentation - get the documentation for the functions and place them in the i file. How the fuck do I do that ?

From source (after "make distclean", this is what you should get with the tarball):
1. ./configure
2. make
all products (lib and jar) are now in lib.

From scratch (after "make allclean", this is what I use for new versions of autoconf):
1. ./get_tools.sh (requires 'automake' package)
2. autoconf (requires 'autoconf-archive' package)
and then as above...

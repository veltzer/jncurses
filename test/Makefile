# GNU makefile to build the solutions.
#
# Fixes done on the solutions:
# 1. moved all solutions to .cc files (to use C++ constants, loop initialization and more).
# 2. fixed up the solutions (handle more error codes in return and more).
# 3. renamed some of the files (for consistant filenames to all solutions).
# 4. cleaned up the source code (standartization).
#
# This makefile:
# - Assumes only one source file per executable and compiles them all
# - Also does -Wall -Werror - so you better write strict code
# - Compiles with the C++ compiler for extra strictness
